# GameDemosViaFrontierLVLM
AI Model Game Dev Showdown: A practical benchmark for code generation. This project tests frontier AI models (Grok, Gemini, GPT, etc.) by prompting them to create playable games from scratch using Python and Pygame. Each model's generated code is run, recorded, and shared to compare their real-world coding abilities.

# AI Model Game Dev Showdown

 <!-- Optional: Create a cool banner for your project -->

A project to benchmark and compare the code generation abilities of frontier and open-source AI models. We test models like **Grok 4**, **Gemini Pro 2.5**, **GPT-5**, and others by tasking them with a simple, practical challenge: create a complete, playable game using Python and the Pygame library.

The goal is to move beyond theoretical benchmarks and see how well these models perform on a real-world, end-to-end creative and logical task.

## The Workflow

This project follows a consistent and transparent workflow to ensure a fair comparison between models.

### 1. Game Concept Generation
To avoid bias in the game description, we begin by asking a baseline model (currently Gemini Pro) for a detailed description of a classic game (e.g., Tetris, Snake, Pong). This description forms the core of our prompt.

### 2. Prompt Engineering
A standardized prompt is created for each game. The prompt is designed to give every model the same starting context and instructions. It always follows this structure:

```
I want to design a game, I would like to do it using library pygame (I have everything setup for this already), I want to start in Pycharm Community edition using: if __name__ == "__main__": main()

[Detailed description of the game from Step 1 is inserted here.]
```

### 3. Code Generation
The exact same prompt from Step 2 is then fed into a new, clean chat session for each of the models being tested. We currently plan to test:
*   Gemini Pro 2.5 (or latest)
*   Grok 4 (or latest)
*   GPT-5 (or latest)
*   Leading Open Source Models (e.g., GPT-OSS 120B, QWEN, DeepSeek)

### 4. Implementation & Archiving
The raw, unedited Python code generated by each model is saved into a dedicated file. The project is organized by game, with each folder containing the prompt and the code from each model. This ensures full transparency and reproducibility. All generated code is run using **Python 3.x** and **Pygame**.

### 5. Evaluation & Showcase
Finally, we run the code. The resulting gameplay (or lack thereof) is recorded in a short video clip (under 5 minutes) and uploaded to our [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/your-channel-link-here). This provides a clear, visual demonstration of the model's success, errors, and overall "understanding" of the task.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by the game being tested. Each game has its own folder containing the prompt used and the resulting code from each AI model.

## Results & Analysis

Here we will track the results of each test.

| Game | Description | Models | Code Link | Gameplay Video | Status & Notes |
| :-------- | :------------- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tetris** | A classic puzzle game where players rotate and place falling geometric shapes, called Tetriminos, to create and clear solid horizontal lines. The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen. | Gemini Pro 2.5, Grok 4, GPT-5 | [Link](./Tetris/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | GPT-5 only one to generate a `Fully Functional` Game that worked as expected for over 5 minutes. |
| **Asteroids** | A 2D vector-based space shooter where the player pilots a ship with momentum-based physics. The goal is to survive waves of asteroids by shooting them, which causes them to break into smaller, faster pieces in a wrap-around screen. | ... | [Link](./PyRoids/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Block Blast** | An endless puzzle game on an 8x8 grid. Players strategically place un-rotatable block shapes to clear full horizontal or vertical lines. The game ends when no more shapes can be placed. | ... | [Link](./BlockBlast/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Breakout** | A fast-paced arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy a wall of bricks. Features different brick types and catchable power-ups like paddle extend and multi-ball. | ... | [Link](./PyBrick/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Donkey Kong** | A single-screen platformer where the player must climb a structure of girders and ladders to rescue a princess while avoiding barrels thrown by an ape, "Kong," at the top of the screen. | ... | [Link](./PyKong/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Frogger** | An action-puzzle game where the player guides a frog across a busy highway and a treacherous river, avoiding vehicles and hopping on moving logs and turtles to reach one of five homes before time runs out. | ... | [Link](./PyFrogger/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Memory Game** | A tile-based memory game where the player flips over pairs of face-down cards on a grid. The objective is to find all matching pairs. A non-matching pair is briefly shown before being flipped back. | ... | [Link](./PyMemo/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Pac Man** | A maze-based game where the player eats all pellets while being pursued by four ghosts with unique AI personalities. Eating power pellets allows the player to temporarily eat the ghosts for bonus points. | ... | [Link](./Py-Man/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Pong** | A 2D simulation of table tennis. Two players control paddles to deflect a ball. Points are scored when an opponent fails to return the ball. The gameplay is enhanced by randomly spawning power-ups. | ... | [Link](./PyPong/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Snake** | A classic arcade game where the player controls a growing snake on a grid. The objective is to eat food, which increases the snake's length and the score. The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body. | ... | [Link](./PySnake/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Sokoban** | A tile-based puzzle game where the player pushes boxes onto designated storage locations within a maze. The game is turn-based and features an undo mechanic to reverse moves. | ... | [Link](./PySoko/) | [Watch](https://youtube.com/link) | ... |
| **Tank Duel** | A top-down 2D arena shooter where the player's tank faces one or more AI tanks in a maze of destructible blocks.
