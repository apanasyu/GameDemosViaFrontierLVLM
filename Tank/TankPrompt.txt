I want to design a game, I would like to do it using library pygame (I have everything setup for this already), I want to start in Pycharm Community edition using: if __name__ == "__main__": main() Here is the description of the game: Tank Duel — Game Design Document (GDD) 1) High‑Concept Top‑down 2D arena shooter where a Green (player) tank faces an Orange (AI) tank inside a grid of destructible blocks. Tanks use the blocks as temporary cover while maneuvering for line‑of‑sight shots. A single hit destroys a tank (one‑shot kill). Minimal, readable visuals; tight controls; short, replayable rounds. 2) Objectives & Player Fantasy Objective: Eliminate the enemy tank before it eliminates you. Play time per round: 20–90 seconds. Outcome: On hit, the destroyed tank flashes red; a GAME OVER modal appears offering N (keyboard) or New Game (mouse) to restart. 3) Core Gameplay Loop Spawn: Player at bottom‑left corridor; AI at top‑right corridor. Procedurally seeded block layout. Position: Navigate corridors, peek from behind cover. Engage: Secure line of sight (LOS) and fire. Bullets that hit blocks remove them (opening new lanes). Resolve: A successful hit ends the round. Restart quickly and repeat. 4) Controls Movement: Arrow keys (WASD also allowed). Movement is free within the arena but axis‑constrained by collisions. Fire: SPACE fires one bullet in the current facing (cardinal) direction; fire rate limited by cooldown. Restart: N to start a new round; or click New Game button at top‑center. Quit: Esc. 5) Game Rules Arena: Orthogonal grid of cells (default 7 rows × 12 cols, cell size 64 px). Each inner cell can contain a block (cover). Blocks: Solid, destructible. When a bullet intersects a block, the block disappears. Tanks: AABB collision with arena walls and blocks. Single health (1 hit = destroyed). Facing is one of up/down/left/right and matches turret direction. Bullets: Travel in a straight line at constant speed; disappear on leaving the arena or after any collision. AI: Line‑of‑Sight firing: If the player is visible (no blocks between tank centers), aim and shoot with cooldown. Navigation: If LOS is blocked, pathfind across the free‑cell grid toward player using BFS (recomputed periodically), or wander briefly when no valid path. Movement: Same collision rules and max speed as the player (slightly slower by default). Win/Lose: First valid hit ends the round. A red overlay renders on the destroyed tank; GAME OVER modal appears with restart options. 6) Visual & UI Specification Style: Minimal shapes (rectangles & circles). Tank bodies are colored rectangles with a barrel line for facing. Arena frame: Thin dark outline surrounding the grid. Blocks: Filled dark squares with small corner radius. Bullets: Small dark circles. Destroyed tank feedback: Semi‑transparent red overlay atop the tank’s rect for the remainder of the round. HUD: Top strip with a New Game button; round status via modal popup in center on game over. Modal: “GAME OVER” title + outcome string (e.g., “You Win!” / “You Were Hit!”) and restart hints (N / New Game). make the arena denser, tanks smaller, and add auto-advancing levels that double the number of enemies each time (1 → 2 → 4 → 8 …).
