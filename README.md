# GameDemosViaFrontierLVLM
AI Model Game Dev Showdown: A practical benchmark for code generation. This project tests frontier AI models (Grok, Gemini, GPT, etc.) by prompting them to create playable games from scratch using Python and Pygame. Each model's generated code is run, recorded, and shared to compare their real-world coding abilities.
